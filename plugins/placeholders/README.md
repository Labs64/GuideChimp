## Placeholders

Allow dynamic placeholders in the tour definition.

### Installation

Please refer to the plugins' installation and configuration Wiki [page](https://github.com/Labs64/GuideChimp/wiki/Configure#plugins).

### Methods
- `setPlaceholders(placeholders)` - set (overwrite) global placeholders
    - `placeholders (Object)` - placeholders object
- `addPlaceholder(key, value)` - add global placeholder
    - `key (string)` - placeholder key(without braces)
    - `value (string or number)` - placeholder value
- `addPlaceholders(placeholders)` - add global placeholders
    - `placeholders (Object)` - key:value object
- `removePlaceholder(key)` - remove global placeholder
    - `key (string)` - placeholder key
- `removePlaceholders(keys)` - remove global placeholders
    - `keys (Array or null)` - an array of placeholder keys, if not specified, will remove all global placeholders

### How To Use
The plugin allows you to define both global placeholders and placeholders for a specific step.

```javascript
    var tour = [
            {
                title: 'Welcome to {companyName}',
                description: 'We are glad to welcome you to the site of an {companyName} company, take this tour to get acquainted with the product.',
            },
            /* Output:
             * { 
             *      title: 'Welcome to BestCompany',
             *      description: 'We are glad to welcome you to the site of an BestCompany company, take this tour to get acquainted with the product.',
             * }
            */
            {
                element: '#logo-{id}',
                title: 'Thank you {username}',
                description: 'Thank you {username} for making it to the end of the tour, hope you like the product of the company {companyName}',
                // step placeholders
                placeholders: { id: 'main' }
            },
            /* Output:
             * {
             *      element: '#logo-main',
             *      title: 'Thank you John Doe',
             *      description: 'Thank you John Doe for making it to the end of the tour, hope you like the product of the company BestCompany',
             * }
             */
        ]

    var guide = GuideChimp(tour);

    // global placeholders
    guide.setPlaceholders({
        username: 'John Doe',
        companyName: 'BestCompany',
    });   
```
_NOTICE!!! If you have the same placeholder key globally and in the step definition, then the value will be taken from the step placeholder because the step placeholders have a higher priority._

#### Asynchronous fetching of placeholders
It often happens that you need to perform some action before you can return a placeholder object. For example, get the values of placeholders after ajax query. In such cases, it will be convenient to use the step property `placeholders` as a function.

```javascript
var tour = [
        {
            title: 'Hello {username}',
            description: 'We are glad that you have used the services of the {companyName} company',
            // step placeholders as function
            placeholders() {
                // GuideChimp will wait for promises to end
                return fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
                    .then((response) => {
                        return response.json();
                    })
                    .then((user) => {
                        return { username: user.name };
                    });
            }
        },
        /* Output:
         * {
         *      title: 'Hello Leanne Graham',
         *      description: 'We are glad that you have used the services of the BestCompany company',
         * }
         */
    ]

    var guide = GuideChimp(tour);

    guide.addPlaceholder('companyName', 'BestCompany');
```
#### Placeholder template
Sometimes it is necessary to change the template of a placeholder, for example when it conflicts with other libraries or frameworks. To do this, you can pass a new placeholder template in the guide–°himp options.
```javascript
var tour = [
        {
            title: 'Welcome to %companyName%',
            description: 'We are glad to welcome you to the site of an %companyName% company, take this tour to get acquainted with the product.',
            placeholders: { companyName: 'BestCompany' },
        },
    ]

var guide = GuideChimp(tour, { placeholderTemplate: '%*%' });
```
